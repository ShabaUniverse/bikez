          Riding the Path of Freedom: Embracing the Joys of Cycling
        </h2>
        <p className="text-xl font-normal text-center mt-5">
          Welcome to our bicycle blog, where we celebrate the simple yet
          profound pleasure of riding a bicycle. Beyond being a means of
          transport, cycling is a liberating experience that reconnects us with
          nature, improves our well-being, and fosters a sense of community.
          Join us on this journey as we explore the joys, benefits, and
          adventures that await those who choose to ride the path of freedom.
